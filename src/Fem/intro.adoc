== Feminising Guide

This section of the guide is intended for individuals who seek to feminise their body in any way. This will obviously largely be <<transfeminine,transfeminine>> people, and as such this section of the guide is written primarily for an audience of <<AMAB>> transfems, however there may be parts applicable to some <<transmasculine,transmascs>>, and not all parts of this guide will be applicable to all transfems - feel free to skip sections that refer to changes you are not interested in.

TIP: There is a huge wealth of possible medical transition paths available to you, involving almost infinite combinations of different regimens and procedures - and you should go down whatever path is right for you
