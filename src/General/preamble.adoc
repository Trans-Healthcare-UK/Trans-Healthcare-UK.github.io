Trans Healthcare UK Guide is an ongoing, collaborative project to produce the most comprehensive recourse possible on what trans healthcare is and how to get it. This is not a politically neutral project, the authors are clear about their political positions when it comes to trans healthcare and will advocate for them. However, we aim to present all possible information about all possible routes of transition as neutrally as possible, so _you_, the reader, can make up your own mind. There is a lot of information here, and most of it won't be applicable to you. If you want to know more about this project, how to read this guide, our politics, and how to get involved, continue reading. If not, head straight to the transmasc or transfem introduction and we'll try and guide you through. Happy transitioning!!
